Description:
My project is a web base application name ClarencGamingDen that uses Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. ClarenceGamingDen is a Web site where I reviewed games that I played this year on my PC. After I reviewed the games I played, I then posted them on my site, wrote the review, and I scored them. Once the user reads all my reviews for each game, they can click the quiz link to answer a question. The user will have to guess which game is my favorite. The question will give the user a right or wrong answer. Once the user is done, he or she can click on the comment link to leave their thoughts on each of the games that I have reviewed.

Here's a list of the files, templates, and the CSS styles that I have used. The files:

The app.py is where I used all the python code to have my web base application to be functional. Also, this is where the SQL operates and stores all the information in the database.
Project.db is where the usernames, passwords, and the user comments are stored.
The flask session is where all the flask files are stored.
The Templates folder:

The apology.html is to display all the apologies for the user to see.
The comment.html is where the user can post their comments about the games that were reviewed. This will display the user comments and the time stamp.
The favorite.html is where the question is located at. Here is where I use JavaScript to give an answer to the user when they select.
The forspoken.html is where the game Forspoken logo and my review is located at.
The sw.html is where the game Star Wars: Survivor logo and my review is located at.
Hogwarts.html is where the game Hogwarts Legacy logo and my review is located at.
The index.html is my home page.
The layout.html is where my title and the nav bar are located at.
The login.html is where the user login is displayed at.
The register.html is where the user register is displayed at.
The static folder contains these files:

forspoken.webp - this contains the photo of the game forspoken.
gamepad.png - this contains the photo of the gamepad that is displayed in the browser.
hogwart.webp - this contains the photo of the game Hogwarts Legacy.
mgames.webp - this contains the photo of many games that are displayed on my home page.
sw.jpg - this contains the photo of the game Star Wars: Survivor.
The styles.css folder contain all of the designs for the HTML files.
