#### Description:

My project is a web base application name ClarencGamingDen that uses Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
ClarenceGamingDen is a Web site that I reviewed games that I play this year on my PC. After I review the games
I played, I then post them on my site, write the review, and I scored them. Once the user read all of my reviews for
each games, they can click the quiz link to answer a question. The user will have to guess which game is my favorite.
The question will give the user a right or wrong answer. Once the user is done, he or she can click on the comment link
to leave their thoughts on each of the games that I have reviewed.

Here's a list of the files, templates, and the css styles that I have used.

The files:

* The app.py is where I used all of the python code to have my web base appilcation to be functional. Also, this is where the SQL operates at and stores all the information to the database.
* The Project.db is where the user names, passwords, and the user comments are stored.
* The flask_session is where all the flask files are stored.

The Templates folder:

* The apology.html is to display all the apologies for the user to see.
* The comment.html is where the user can post their comments about the games that was reviewed. This will display the user comments and the time stamp.
* The favorite.html is where question is located at. Here is where I use the JavaScript to give an anwser to the user when they make a selection.
* The forspoken.html is where the game Forspoken logo and my review is located at.
* The sw.html is where the game Star Wars: Surviver logo and my review is located at.
* The hogwart.html is where the game Hogwart Lagacy logo and my review is located at.
* The index.html is my home page.
* The layout.html is where my title and the nav bar is located at.
